# coins-JD-detection

#Overview:
In this project, we develop a machine learning system designed to detect and accurately count coins. Our goal is to enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and streamline financial processes.

# Objectives:
    * create a deep-learning model for coins detection using roboflow
    * Provide a user-friendly demo using roboflow

# Data Collection:
We collect images for Jordanian currencies(0.05  0.1  0.25  0.5 1  5  10  20  50)

   *capturing images using a camera or mobile device.
   *images from the internet
